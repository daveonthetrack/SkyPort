# SkyPort Build Issues - Fixed & Remaining

## ‚úÖ **FIXED ISSUES**

### 1. WebSocket/Node.js Module Import Error
**Problem**: Supabase was trying to import Node.js modules (`ws`, `url`) that aren't available in React Native.

**Solution**: Updated `metro.config.js` with proper polyfills:
- Added `react-native-url-polyfill/auto` for WebSocket and URL handling
- Configured proper Node.js module polyfills
- Added resolver to handle WebSocket imports

### 2. Metro Runtime Compatibility
**Problem**: Outdated `@expo/metro-runtime` causing bundling issues.

**Solution**: Updated to `@expo/metro-runtime@~5.0.4`

### 3. Build Process
**Problem**: App wasn't bundling due to module resolution issues.

**Solution**: The app now successfully bundles and runs! üéâ

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **REMAINING ISSUES TO FIX**

### 1. Missing Storage Buckets (CRITICAL)
**Problem**: Image uploads failing with "Bucket not found" error.

**Root Cause**: The `items` and `avatars` storage buckets don't exist in Supabase.

**Solution Options**:

#### Option A: Manual Setup via Supabase Dashboard
1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to Storage
3. Create these buckets:
   - `items` (public: true)
   - `avatars` (public: true)
   - `chat_images` (public: true) 
   - `chat_audio` (public: true)
   - `verifications` (public: false)

#### Option B: Use the Setup Script
1. Add your Supabase service role key to `.env`:
   ```
   SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key_here
   ```
2. Run: `node scripts/setup-storage.js`

#### Option C: Run SQL Migration
Execute the SQL in `supabase/migrations/20240327000000_create_items_and_trips.sql` in your Supabase SQL editor.

### 2. Database Tables Missing
**Problem**: The app references `items` and `trips` tables that may not exist.

**Solution**: Run the migration SQL to create these tables with proper RLS policies.

### 3. Deprecated Package Warnings
**Problem**: Several packages have deprecation warnings.

**Solutions**:
- Replace `expo-av` with `expo-audio` and `expo-video` (SDK 54 requirement)
- Update `@types/react` to `~19.0.10`
- Consider updating React to 19.0.0 (major change)

### 4. Realtime Subscriptions Timing Out
**Problem**: WebSocket connections for realtime features are timing out.

**Current Status**: This is expected with the current polyfill setup. The app works without realtime features.

**Future Solution**: Consider implementing a custom WebSocket solution or using Supabase's REST API for polling.

## üöÄ **IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS**

1. **Fix Storage Buckets** (Choose one option above)
2. **Create Database Tables** (Run the migration SQL)
3. **Test Image Upload** (Try uploading an item image)

## üì± **Current App Status**

- ‚úÖ App builds and runs successfully
- ‚úÖ Authentication works
- ‚úÖ Navigation works
- ‚úÖ Basic UI renders correctly
- ‚ùå Image uploads fail (storage buckets missing)
- ‚ùå Some database operations may fail (tables missing)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Realtime features timeout (expected)

## üîß **Development Notes**

- The app is now in a working state for development
- Main functionality should work once storage buckets are created
- Consider the deprecated package warnings for future updates
- WebSocket issues are resolved for basic functionality

## üìã **Testing Checklist**

After fixing storage buckets:
- [ ] Sign up/Sign in
- [ ] Upload profile picture
- [ ] Post an item with image
- [ ] Send messages in chat
- [ ] Upload verification documents

The build issues have been largely resolved! The app should now run successfully once the storage buckets are created.
