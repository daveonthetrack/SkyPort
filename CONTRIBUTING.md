# Contributing to SkyPort

Thank you for your interest in contributing to SkyPort! This project showcases advanced React Native development with blockchain integration.

## üéØ What This Project Demonstrates

### **Technical Expertise**
- **React Native + TypeScript**: Professional mobile app development
- **Blockchain Integration**: Production-ready DID (Decentralized Identity) system
- **Real-time Features**: Advanced chat system with Supabase
- **Security**: Hardware-backed key storage and cryptographic operations
- **UI/UX**: Professional design with animations and accessibility

### **Learning Opportunities**
- Modern React Native development patterns
- Blockchain integration in mobile apps
- TypeScript best practices
- Real-time application architecture
- Security-first development

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- React Native development environment
- Understanding of TypeScript
- Basic knowledge of blockchain concepts (helpful for DID features)

### Setup
1. Fork and clone the repository
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure
3. Run `npm install`
4. Start with `npx expo start`

## üìã Development Guidelines

### **Code Quality Standards**
- Follow TypeScript strict mode
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comprehensive error handling
- Include detailed logging for debugging
- Write self-documenting code

### **Architecture Patterns**
- **Context-based state management** for global state
- **Service layer pattern** for business logic
- **Component composition** over inheritance
- **Separation of concerns** between UI and logic

### **Security Considerations**
- Never expose private keys or sensitive data
- Use secure storage methods (keychain/keystore)
- Validate all inputs and sanitize data
- Follow principle of least privilege

## üîç Key Areas for Contribution
