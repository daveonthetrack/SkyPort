# DID (Decentralized Identity) Implementation Roadmap

## Overview
Implement Decentralized Identity to enhance trust, verification, and user control in the SkyPort platform while maintaining seamless integration with the existing Supabase authentication system.

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Authentication System
- ✅ Supabase Auth for email/password authentication
- ✅ User profiles with trust levels (0-100)
- ✅ Verification flags: `is_phone_verified`, `is_email_verified`
- ✅ Role-based system: `sender` | `traveler`
- ✅ Trust metrics: `trust_level`, `completed_deliveries`

### Integration Strategy
**Hybrid Approach**: Keep Supabase for app functionality, add DID for enhanced trust and portability.

## Phase 1: Foundation & Setup (Week 1-2)

### 1.1 Dependencies Installation
```bash
npm install --save \
  @decentralized-identity/ion-tools \
  @decentralized-identity/did-common-typescript \
  did-resolver \
  ethr-did-resolver \
  @metamask/eth-sig-util \
  react-native-crypto \
  react-native-get-random-values
```

### 1.2 Core DID Infrastructure
- DID Document creation and management
- Key pair generation and storage
- DID resolution and verification
- Secure key storage using React Native Keychain

### 1.3 Database Schema Extension
```sql
-- Add DID-related fields to profiles table
ALTER TABLE profiles ADD COLUMN did_identifier TEXT UNIQUE;
ALTER TABLE profiles ADD COLUMN did_document JSONB;
ALTER TABLE profiles ADD COLUMN public_key TEXT;
ALTER TABLE profiles ADD COLUMN did_created_at TIMESTAMP;
ALTER TABLE profiles ADD COLUMN did_updated_at TIMESTAMP;

-- Create verifiable credentials table
CREATE TABLE verifiable_credentials (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES profiles(id),
  credential_type TEXT NOT NULL,
  issuer_did TEXT NOT NULL,
  subject_did TEXT NOT NULL,
  credential_data JSONB NOT NULL,
  proof JSONB NOT NULL,
  issued_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
  expires_at TIMESTAMP,
  revoked_at TIMESTAMP,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT now()
);

-- Create DID verification table
CREATE TABLE did_verifications (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES profiles(id),
  verification_type TEXT NOT NULL,
  verifier_did TEXT NOT NULL,
  verification_data JSONB NOT NULL,
  verification_proof JSONB NOT NULL,
  verified_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
  expires_at TIMESTAMP,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT now()
);
```

## Phase 2: Core DID Implementation (Week 3-4)

### 2.1 DID Service Layer
Create services for:
- DID creation and management
- Credential issuance and verification
- Key management and rotation
- DID document updates

### 2.2 DID Context Integration
- Extend AuthContext with DID functionality
- Seamless integration with existing authentication flow
- Backwards compatibility for existing users

### 2.3 User Experience Flow
```typescript
// New user registration flow
1. User signs up with email/password (existing flow)
2. App generates DID automatically in background
3. User completes profile setup
4. DID is anchored and linked to profile
5. Initial verifiable credentials are issued

// Existing user migration flow
1. Detect users without DID on login
2. Prompt for DID creation (optional)
3. Generate DID and link to existing profile
4. Migrate existing verification status to VCs
```

## Phase 3: Verifiable Credentials (Week 5-6)

### 3.1 Credential Types for SkyPort
```typescript
interface SkyPortCredentials {
  // Identity Verification
  EmailVerificationCredential: {
    email: string;
    verified_at: string;
    verification_method: string;
  };
  
  PhoneVerificationCredential: {
    phone_number: string;
    verified_at: string;
    verification_method: string;
  };
  
  // Trust & Reputation
  TrustLevelCredential: {
    trust_level: number;
    completed_deliveries: number;
    calculated_at: string;
    valid_until: string;
  };
  
  // Delivery History
  DeliveryCompletionCredential: {
    delivery_id: string;
    from_location: string;
    to_location: string;
    completed_at: string;
    rating: number;
    value_handled: number;
  };
  
  // Platform Specific
  TravelerCredential: {
    routes_completed: number;
    avg_rating: number;
    specializations: string[];
    verified_since: string;
  };
  
  SenderCredential: {
    items_sent: number;
    avg_rating: number;
    payment_history: string;
    verified_since: string;
  };
}
```

### 3.2 Credential Issuance Flow
- Automatic credential issuance for verified actions
- Self-sovereign credential management
- Revocation and renewal mechanisms

## Phase 4: Trust Network & Verification (Week 7-8)

### 4.1 Decentralized Trust Network
- Peer-to-peer verifications
- Cross-platform reputation import/export
- Trust score aggregation from multiple sources

### 4.2 Verification Workflows
```typescript
// Enhanced verification process
interface VerificationRequest {
  user_did: string;
  verification_type: 'phone' | 'email' | 'identity' | 'address';
  evidence: any;
  verifier: 'platform' | 'peer' | 'third_party';
}
```

### 4.3 Integration Points
- Chat system: Display DID-verified badges
- User profiles: Show verifiable credentials
- Delivery matching: Trust-based recommendations

## Phase 5: Advanced Features (Week 9-10)

### 5.1 Cross-Platform Portability
- Export DID and credentials to other platforms
- Import external verifications
- Standardized trust metrics

### 5.2 Smart Contract Integration
- On-chain reputation anchoring
- Credential attestations
- Dispute resolution with verified identities

### 5.3 Privacy & Selective Disclosure
- Zero-knowledge proofs for sensitive data
- Selective credential sharing
- Privacy-preserving trust calculations

## Implementation Benefits

## Technical Architecture

### DID Method Selection
**Recommended**: `did:ethr` (Ethereum-based)
- Mature ecosystem
- Cost-effective on Layer 2
- Good tool support
- Wide adoption

### Key Components
```typescript
interface DIDArchitecture {
  didService: DIDManagementService;
  credentialService: VerifiableCredentialService;
  verificationService: TrustVerificationService;
  keyManagement: SecureKeyManager;
  resolver: DIDResolver;
}
```

### Security Considerations
- Hardware-backed key storage where available
- Secure enclave utilization on iOS
- Android Keystore integration
- Biometric authentication for key operations
- Key rotation and recovery mechanisms

## Success Metrics

### Phase 1 KPIs
- DID creation success rate > 95%
- Key generation time < 2 seconds
- Zero data loss during migration

### Phase 2 KPIs
- User adoption rate of DID features > 60%
- Credential issuance success rate > 98%
- Performance impact < 200ms additional load time

### Phase 3 KPIs

- Fraud reduction > 30%
- User satisfaction with verification process > 4.5/5

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Backup Strategy**: Multiple key recovery options
- **Performance**: Optimize crypto operations
- **Compatibility**: Gradual rollout with fallbacks

### User Adoption Risks
- **Education**: Clear benefits communication
- **Opt-in Approach**: Not mandatory for existing users
- **Incentives**: Rewards for DID adoption

### Regulatory Risks
- **Compliance**: GDPR, data residency requirements
- **Standards**: Follow W3C DID specifications
- **Audit**: Regular security assessments
