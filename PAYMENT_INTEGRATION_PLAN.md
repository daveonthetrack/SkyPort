# 💳 SkyPort Payment Integration Plan

## 🎯 Vision: DID-Enhanced Payment System

Transform SkyPort into a **Web3-enabled travel/delivery platform** with cryptographic identity and secure payments.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

```
User Identity (DID) → Trust Scoring → Payment Authorization → Secure Transactions
      ↓                    ↓               ↓                    ↓
  Blockchain ID      Reputation Score   Payment Gateway    Real-time Updates
```

## 📋 Phase 1: Traditional Payments + DID

### **Stripe Integration with DID Enhancement**

#### Features:
- ✅ **Fiat Payments**: Credit cards, bank transfers, digital wallets
- ✅ **DID Verification**: Cryptographic identity before payment
- ✅ **Trust-Based Pricing**: Dynamic fees based on reputation
- ✅ **Escrow System**: Secure fund holding until delivery

#### Implementation:
```typescript
// Payment Service with DID Integration
interface PaymentWithDID {
  didIdentifier: string;
  trustScore: number;
  verifiedCredentials: VerifiableCredential[];
  paymentMethod: StripePaymentMethod;
  escrowAmount: number;
  deliveryConfirmation: boolean;
}
```

#### Benefits:
- **Reduced Fraud**: DID + Trust Score = Lower chargeback risk
- **Dynamic Pricing**: Trust-based fee adjustments
- **Instant Verification**: Crypto signatures for payment approval
- **Reputation Tracking**: Payment history tied to DID

## 📋 Phase 2: Crypto Payment Integration

### **Web3 Wallet Support**

#### Features:
- ✅ **Multi-Currency**: ETH, USDC, USDT, Polygon MATIC
- ✅ **Wallet Connect**: MetaMask, WalletConnect, Coinbase Wallet
- ✅ **Smart Contracts**: Automated escrow and release
- ✅ **Gas Optimization**: Layer 2 solutions (Polygon, Arbitrum)

#### DID + Crypto Benefits:
```typescript
// Smart Contract with DID Verification
contract SkyPortEscrow {
    mapping(string => UserProfile) didProfiles;
    
    function createDeliveryContract(
        string memory senderDID,
        string memory travelerDID,
        uint256 amount,
        bytes memory deliveryTerms
    ) external {
        require(verifyDID(senderDID), "Invalid sender DID");
        require(verifyDID(travelerDID), "Invalid traveler DID");
        // Create escrow contract...
    }
}
```

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### **Database Extensions**
```sql
-- Add payment-related columns to profiles
ALTER TABLE profiles ADD COLUMN stripe_customer_id TEXT;
ALTER TABLE profiles ADD COLUMN wallet_address TEXT;
ALTER TABLE profiles ADD COLUMN payment_reputation DECIMAL(3,2);

-- Create payments table
CREATE TABLE payments (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    sender_did TEXT REFERENCES profiles(did_identifier),
    traveler_did TEXT REFERENCES profiles(did_identifier),
    amount DECIMAL(10,2),
    currency TEXT,
    payment_type TEXT, -- 'fiat' or 'crypto'
    status TEXT,
    escrow_released BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### **React Native Integration**
```typescript
// Payment Context with DID
interface PaymentContextType {
  createPayment: (amount: number, currency: string) => Promise<Payment>;
  verifyPaymentWithDID: (paymentId: string) => Promise<boolean>;
  releaseEscrow: (deliveryProof: DeliveryProof) => Promise<void>;
  getPaymentHistory: () => Promise<Payment[]>;
}
```

## 🎯 Unique Value Propositions

### **1. Trust-Based Pricing**
```typescript
// Dynamic fee calculation based on DID reputation
const calculateFees = (amount: number, trustScore: number) => {
  const baseFee = amount * 0.03; // 3% base
  const trustDiscount = trustScore > 90 ? 0.5 : trustScore > 70 ? 0.7 : 1.0;
  return baseFee * trustDiscount;
};
```

### **2. Cryptographic Payment Verification**
```typescript
// Sign payment authorization with DID private key
const authorizePayment = async (paymentDetails: PaymentDetails) => {
  const signature = await didService.signWithDID(userId, JSON.stringify(paymentDetails));
  return {
    ...paymentDetails,
    didSignature: signature,
    timestamp: Date.now()
  };
};
```

### **3. Decentralized Dispute Resolution**
```typescript
// DID-based evidence submission
interface DisputeEvidence {
  submitterDID: string;
  evidence: VerifiableCredential[];
  cryptographicProof: string;
  mediaAttachments: string[];
}
```
